simple_docx_rst
===============

This tiny GUI app opens a .docx file and displays it in reStructuredText
format.

Because it is targetting specific documents to clean them up and
potentially fully translate them to rst, it's not meant as a general
purpose converter.

Uses python-docx, lxml, scintilla, wxPython and others

TODO
====

- Table parsing to be added

- Differentiate between bullet and numbered lists
